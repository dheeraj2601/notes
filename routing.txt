Route Refresh

rfc 2918

old - part of OPEN message. Optional Parameter-capability
new - new message type

Soft Reconfig maintains a separate unmodified database for a neighbor, and is used only when explicitly configured. 
Route Refresh adds another message to BGP allowing a router to ask its peer to resend the routes again, and requires no
configuration whatsoever. Soft Reconfig should not be used anymore, as it was just a workaround. Simply do nothing, and
you get Route Refresh

Dynamic Capability
------------------

https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-idr-dynamic-cap-00.txt

   By advertising the Dynamic Capability to a peer in the OPEN, a BGP
   speaker conveys to the peer that the speaker is capable of receiving
   and properly handling the CAPABILITY message (as defined in the next
   Section) from the peer after the BGP session has been established.
